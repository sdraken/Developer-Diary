## Format 
This is where I'll list my projects. My goal with these projects is to both highlight my current capabilities, and to learn new things. The exact format of this page is not set in stone, but it should include two main things. Most importantly are links to my other projects. The links should be accompanied with a short description of the project, as well as what capabilities the project highlights. I also want to keep track of the capabilities that I want to demonstrate in a project. These capabilities can be roughly categorized into two main categories. 
1. Directly related to software development (i.e. Algorithms, Data Structures, Distributed Version Control, Databases, etc.)  
2. Mathematics (i.e. Calculus, Algebra, Discrete Mathematics, etc.)
