## Format 
The Developer Diary will be contained within this singular markdown file. I might change this as the number of projects increase, but right now I'll keep it simple. 

Each entry starts with a header specifying the date. The diary is sorted in descending order with respect to dates. That is to say, new entries are placed at the top. 

There aren't going to be daily updates (Maybe "Developer Logbook" would have been a more descriptive name) but substantial changes in any of my projects should be reflected in the diary. 

## 2024/08/25
The first project has been decided upon, [Distributed-Version-Control-101](https://github.com/sdraken/Distributed-Version-Control-101). Since I'll be using Git to manage all of my projects, it only seemed natural to go over distributed version control before anything else. The idea is to give an overview of what I know, and to develop a standard workflow for Git/GitHub that I'll be using throughout my other projects

I'm still changing the formatting of this repo, and I suspect it'll take a while until I find a look I'm completely satisfied with. The Developer-Diary repo might be replaced with a webpage once I start looking at getting my own website up and running, but that remains to be seen.

I know that for software development I'll be trying to avoid having unrelated changes appear in the same commit. I'll be lenient on repositories that are mostly text because their main challenge is the actual writing, keeping track of changes isn't as important.
