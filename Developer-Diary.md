## Format 
The Developer Diary will be contained within this singular markdown file. I might change this as the number of projects increase, but right now I'll keep it simple. 

Each entry starts with a header specifying the date. The diary is sorted in descending order with respect to dates. That is to say, new entries are placed at the top. 

There aren't going to be daily updates (Maybe "Developer Logbook" would have been a more descriptive name) but substantial changes in any of my projects should be reflected in the diary.
